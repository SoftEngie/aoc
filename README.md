# Advent of Code Solutions in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges, implemented in the Rust programming language.
Each day of the event, I will be publishing my approach and code for the respective puzzles.

## Repository Structure

The project structure follows the template provided by fspoettel's Rust Advent of Code template.
This template includes a clean setup for solving and running the daily puzzles with Rust,
making it easier to focus on solving the problems while adhering to best practices.

Feel free to explore the solutions and contribute by discussing different approaches!
